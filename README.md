## Welcome to My ePortfolio


# Self-Assessment
As a Computer Science major concentrating in Software Engineering, I gained specific skills and various fundamentals while studying at Southern New Hampshire University. These fundamentals include syntax structure basics, object-oriented programming, scripting essentials, theoretical computer science, and software engineering principles. Not every fundamental consists of the Computer Science major, where the applied skills I developed originate from my Software Engineering concentration. The combination of the Computer Science and Software Engineering disciplines has enabled me to comprehend theory and use such a view in realistic situations involving software products. With the knowledge I have gained in the Computer Science program, I have demonstrated a mastery level of understanding automata, algorithms, data structures, tree traversals, architectures, and other computing processes in my course work. Several course outcomes I have grasped for Software Engineering include reverse engineering, secure coding, database creation, optimization, UML design, computational graphics, advanced testing methods, and mobile application development. The comprehension and mastery of both Computer Science and Software Engineering principles ensure my preparedness for the Software Engineering industry.

## Strengths
Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio assist in showcasing my strengths due to the knowledge I have gained throughout the Computer Science program. In addition, the coursework shapes my professional goals by providing me with the necessary skills for the Software Engineering industry. Finally, utilizing the projects within the program and demonstrating my abilities within this ePortfolio prepare me to become more employable in the field, as the rigor of the projects and the comprehension of Computer Science material in the ePortfolio strengthen my abilities. Specific examples from my program include applying automata to a temperature sensor project, creating a three-dimensional scene using OpenGL and C++, and developing a database with a geolocation chart for a dog shelter. Thus, the skills I gained from the program's course material conclude to strengthen and prepare me for the demand of the Software Engineering field.  

## Team Environment Collaboration
Throughout the Computer Science program, I had the ability to collaborate with others in team environments. I utilized version control for pushing local projects to remote projects, where I gained feedback from my peers. In addition, I created pull requests to review the work of others. I then worked in groups where we discussed and analyzed data together. The majority of the communication in my program was asynchronous, and our teams saved time on reviewing our work. Experiencing the hands-on practices of collaborating in teams allowed me to familiarize myself with realistic industry situations. The team collaboration skills I am familiar with will solidify my relative soft skills in the Software Engineering industry.

## Communicating To Stakeholders
The Computer Science program provided me with the skills necessary for communicating to stakeholders. As Software Engineering professionals are required to explain projects, lifecycles, and create updates for different parties, communicating to stakeholders is a crucial skill to familiarize with. Throughout the program, I created business related documentation and security policies that considered stakeholders. In addition, I created plans that detailed stakeholder requirements for a software product. The plans, policies, and documentation I created solidifies my professional soft skills in the Software Engineering industry. 

## Data Structures And Algorithms
The data structures and algorithms work within the Computer Science program prepared me for realistic situations regarding stored data that is to be executed. The initial experiences I had with data structures and algorithms were on studying their functionality in the course IT 145: Foundation in Application Development. The initial experiences were followed by understanding how to document and explain their functionality in IT 365: Operating Environments. I then learned how to apply my learning to projects in CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. Finally, I advanced my understanding through utilizing unit testing for data structures and algorithms in CS 405: Secure Coding. The foundations of data structures and algorithms I mastered assisted me in my enhanced work for this category.
