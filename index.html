<h2>Welcome to My ePortfolio</h2>  

<h1>Self-Assessment</h1>  
<p>As a computer science major concentrating in software engineering, I gained specific skills and various fundamentals while studying at Southern New Hampshire University. 
  These fundamentals include syntax structure basics, object-oriented programming, scripting essentials, theoretical computer science, and software engineering principles. 
  Not every fundamental consists of the computer science major, where the applied skills I developed originate from my software engineering concentration. 
  The combination of the computer science and software engineering disciplines has enabled me to comprehend theory and use such a view in realistic situations involving software products. 
  With the knowledge I have gained in the computer science program, I have demonstrated a mastery level of understanding automata, algorithms, data structures, tree traversals, architectures, and other computing processes in my course work. 
  Several course outcomes I have grasped for software engineering include reverse engineering, secure coding, database creation, optimization, UML design, computational graphics, advanced testing methods, and mobile application development. 
  The comprehension and mastery of both computer science and software engineering principles ensure my preparedness for the software engineering industry.</p>
