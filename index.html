<h2>Welcome to My ePortfolio</h2>  

<h1>Self-Assessment</h1>  
<p>As a computer science major concentrating in software engineering, I gained specific skills and various fundamentals while studying at Southern New Hampshire University. 
  These fundamentals include syntax structure basics, object-oriented programming, scripting essentials, theoretical computer science, and software engineering principles. 
  Not every fundamental consists of the computer science major, where the applied skills I developed originate from my software engineering concentration. 
  The combination of the computer science and software engineering disciplines has enabled me to comprehend theory and use such a view in realistic situations involving software products. 
  With the knowledge I have gained in the computer science program, I have demonstrated a mastery level of understanding automata, algorithms, data structures, tree traversals, architectures, and other computing processes in my course work. 
  Several course outcomes I have grasped for software engineering include reverse engineering, secure coding, database creation, optimization, UML design, computational graphics, advanced testing methods, and mobile application development. 
  The comprehension and mastery of both computer science and software engineering principles ensure my preparedness for the software engineering industry.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<p>Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio assist in showcasing my strengths due to the knowledge I have gained throughout the computer science program. 
  In addition, the coursework shapes my professional goals by providing me with the necessary skills for the software engineering industry. 
  Finally, utilizing the projects within the program and demonstrating my abilities within this ePortfolio prepare me to become more employable in the field, as the rigor of the projects and the comprehension of computer science material in the ePortfolio strengthen my abilities. 
  Specific examples from my program include applying automata to a temperature sensor project, creating a three-dimensional scene using OpenGL and C++, and developing a database with a geolocation chart for a dog shelter. 
  Thus, the skills I gained from the program's course material conclude to strengthen and prepare me for the demand of the software engineering field.</p>
  
  
<h2>Team Environment Collaboration</h2>  
<p>Throughout the computer science program, I could collaborate with others in team environments. 
  I utilized version control for pushing local projects to remote projects, where I gained feedback from my peers. 
  In addition, I created pull requests to review the work of others. I then worked in groups where we discussed and analyzed data together. 
  The majority of the communication in my program was asynchronous, and our teams saved time on reviewing our work. 
  Experiencing the hands-on practices of collaborating in teams allowed me to familiarize myself with realistic industry situations. 
  The team collaboration skills I am familiar with will solidify my relative soft skills in the software engineering industry.</p>
